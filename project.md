I want the background to be a linear gradient.
I also need to find a way to make sure the questions  pop one after the other and not all at once.
Maybe I should make the input to look like a transparent line or make it look invisible unless it is clicked on.
I also need to find a way to make the game continuous and only end after a person wins or after a person tries five times and loses.

We could add a count add the side of the project and it would decrease upto zero and then a big message would pop up to say I won or I lost.
