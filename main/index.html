    <h1>GUESSING GAME</h1>
    <p id ='welcome'>Welcome to the guessing game. For this game, you get to choose a range of values, one being the minimum and the other being 
    the maximum. After you have chosen your range, you will be asked to guess a number between the range you have chosen. If you guess correctly, you win. If you guess incorrectly, you will be told whether your guess was too high or too low. You will then be asked to guess again. You will be given 5 chances to guess correctly. If you do not guess correctly after 5 tries, you lose. Good luck!
